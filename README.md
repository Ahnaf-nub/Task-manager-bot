**AI Chatbot Integration**: Interact with a generative AI model powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini API for task-related queries and assistance. Also, by clicking on the added Tasks or Notes gemini can help you to go through it faster!


**Push Notifications**: Real-time reminders using plyer to notify users of approaching task deadlines.

**Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive user interface built with Flet, providing seamless interaction across devices.
### Technologies Used:
**Python**: Core language for application logic.

**PostgreSQL**: Relational database for securely storing user data, tasks, and notes.

**Flet**: Framework for building the application interface.

**Google Gemini API**: For AI-driven conversational capabilities.

**passlib**: For secure password hashing and verification.

**plyer**: For cross-platform push notifications.
